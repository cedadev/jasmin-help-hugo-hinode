## Current cluster specification

LOTUS is a cluster of over 260 nodes/hosts and 50,000 CPU cores. A node/host is
an individual computer in the cluster with more than 1 processor. Each
node/host belongs to a specific host group. Occasionally nodes/hosts are taken
out of the cluster for special purposes. The number of processors (CPUs or
cores) per host is listed in Table 1 with the corresponding processor model
and the size of the physical memory RAM available per node/host.
