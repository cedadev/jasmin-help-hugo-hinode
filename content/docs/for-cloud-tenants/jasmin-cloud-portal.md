The [JASMIN Cloud Portal](https://cloud.jasmin.ac.uk/) is a web interface that
enables the self-service provisioning of virtual machines in the JASMIN Cloud.

Currently, it is built on top of [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) VIO
Horizon. Horizon is a powerful tool for provisioning cloud tenancies but is
easy to misconfigure. The JASMIN Cloud Portal focuses on simplicity, allowing
users to quickly provision the machines they require.
