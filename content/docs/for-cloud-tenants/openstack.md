While we expect most tenants to use Azimuth to interact with the cloud, some may find it beneficial to interact directly with OpenStack. The STFC Cloud team have documentation which contains more information about this.

Start with [basic usage](https://stfc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOUDKB/pages/211746884/Getting+Started), which includes information on:
- command commands with the OpenStack CLI,
- creating application credentials,
- creation and deletion of VMs,
- and adding your SSH key to OpenStack so that it can be added to machines (Azimuth normally does this for you).

The STFC Cloud documentation also covers the following more advanced topics:
- [the use of VMs](https://stfc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOUDKB/pages/267780164/Openstack),
- [working with storage](https://stfc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOUDKB/pages/267780153/Storage),
- and [networking](https://stfc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOUDKB/pages/267616365/Networking).

The STFC Cloud documentation also has information about all the [images which are available to projects, machine flavors, and network information](https://stfc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOUDKB/pages/267714579/Cloud+Overview), beyond what is accessible through the Azimuth Portal.
