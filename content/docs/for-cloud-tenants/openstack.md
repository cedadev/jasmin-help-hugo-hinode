While we expect most tenants to use Azimuth to interact with the cloud, some may find it benificial to interact directly with OpenStack. The STFC Cloud team have put together which contain more information about this.

Basic content can be accessed here: https://stfc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOUDKB/pages/211746884/Getting+Started. This includes information on: command commands with the OpenStack CLI, creating application credentials, creation and deletion of VMs, and adding your SSH key to OpenStack so that it can be added to machines (Azimuth normally does this for you).

More thorough information on the use of VMs in OpenStack is available here: https://stfc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOUDKB/pages/267780164/Openstack, working with storage here: https://stfc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOUDKB/pages/267780153/Storage, and networking here: https://stfc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOUDKB/pages/267616365/Networking

The STFC CLoud documentation also has information about all the images which are available to projects, machine flavors, and network information, beyond what is accessible through the Azimuth Portal. Details here: https://stfc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOUDKB/pages/267714579/Cloud+Overview
