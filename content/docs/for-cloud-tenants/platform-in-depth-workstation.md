### Linux Workstation:

- The Linux Workstation platform offers a flexible Ubuntu 22.04 cloud instance.
- You can access it via a web browser to use the graphical desktop or shell.
- You can also add an external IP address to access the instance from outside the project using SSH.
- The instance includes a cloud volume at /data for large datasets.
- You can set the size of this volume when launching the platform.

### Launch Configuration

Note: Platform names are visible to all project members!
