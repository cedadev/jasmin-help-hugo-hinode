This article explains how to register on the JASMIN accounts portal.
Registering on the accounts portal allows you to apply for JASMIN services and
privileges. It does not by itself provide you with any access to JASMIN
machines or services.

If you need to migrate an existing CEDA account please see:

- [How to migrate an existing CEDA account using the JASMIN account portal]({{< ref "migrate-jasmin-account-from-ceda" >}})

There is a video **tutorial** for the material covered in this article at
[Getting a new JASMIN
account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrUB7UKNcc&index=2&list=PLyBwrm7gQcuV3I1zrI8Rop2WgEP6vPXJL)

## JASMIN account portal

The [JASMIN accounts portal](https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/) is a web
interface utility dedicated to JASMIN users only. This is standalone from
MyCEDA (your CEDA account) and hence a decoupling between the management of
access to JASMIN resources (compute and storage) and CEDA resources (access to
datasets in the archives).

credentials, **register your SSH public key** and then **click Create
