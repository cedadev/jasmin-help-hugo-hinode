## Apply for a new JASMIN account

To apply for a JASMIN account you need to use an email address affiliated with your academic institution. This is the preferred option â€” otherwise your email address may not be immediately approved. Then proceed as follows:

**Step 1**: On the {{<link "jasmin_accounts_portal">}}JASMIN Accounts Portal{{</link>}}
select "Apply for a new JASMIN account". This will take you to the following
page to enter your details.

**Step 2**: Select your research discipline and the degree you are studying for.

**Step 3**: Provide supporting information to assess your
{{<link "https://jasmin.ac.uk/users/access/">}}eligibility for a JASMIN account{{</link>}} and then submit your application.

**Step 4** : After pressing **Submit application**, follow the URL link sent to your email address.

**Step 5** : Once your email has been verified, you will receive a second email 
with a subject 'Application approved' inviting you to complete the account creation.

{{<alert alert-type="info">}}
Depending on the institution you belong to, the 'Application approved' email may take a few working days to arrive. Please use an email address affiliated with your academic institution rather than a personal email.
{{</alert>}}

The link in the 'Application approved' email will take you to the following page where you have to choose your JASMIN account
credentials, register your SSH public key, and then click **Create
account**:

{{<alert alert-type="info">}}
Please note that having a JASMIN portal account does not by itself provide you with any access to JASMIN machines or services. You will next need to [request access to the `jasmin-login` service]({{% ref "get-login-account" %}}) if you want to SSH into JASMIN.
