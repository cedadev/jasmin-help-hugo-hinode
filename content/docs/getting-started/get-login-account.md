## Get a login account

A user with a `jasmin-login` grant is allocated a `HOME` directory of **100GB** and can access the shared JASMIN servers ([scientific servers]({{% ref "sci-servers" %}}), [data transfer servers]({{% ref "transfer-servers" %}})) and [the LOTUS batch cluster]({{% ref "lotus-overview" %}}).

If you have an existing account but are unable to access JASMIN for any reason (e.g., forgotten password, changed email address or institution), **please do not reregister for a new JASMIN account**. If you have already created a new account, please do not apply for the `jasmin-login` service with the new account. Instead, please contact the helpdesk to resolve the issue.

**Step 1:** Sign in into the {{<link "jasmin_accounts_portal">}}JASMIN Accounts Portal{{</link>}} and select ‘Manage JASMIN services’ to navigate to the JASMIN Services page.

**Step 2:** From the ‘Discover Services’ menu on the left, select 'Login Services', then select 'More information' for the `jasmin-login` service.

Please note that `jasmin-login` applications are processed manually by a small team, and depending on the time of year there may be many other users applying at the same time.
The approvals process may also involve contacting any references listed on the application, which can cause further delays. 
Please don't raise a ticket with the helpdesk unless you haven't heard from us after 2 weeks.

**Step 5:** Your request for `jasmin-login` is now pending.

**Step 6:** You will receive a notification of the outcome of your application by email and in the Accounts Portal notifications.

In this example, the request was granted, and the status and expiry date of the grant are displayed on the right hand side:

**Finally,** you can view all the services that you have requested or been granted access to under ['My Services'](https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/services/my_services/).

Once your `jasmin-login` application is approved, proceed to [How to login]({{% ref "how-to-login" %}}) to access the login servers and scientific servers.
