title: Apply for access to a GWS

This article explains how to apply for access to a GWS from the JASMIN Accounts
Portal.

**Step 1:** Sign in to the [JASMIN Accounts
Portal](https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/) and select 'Manage JASMIN services' to navigate to the JASMIN Services page. From the 'Discover Services' menu on the left, select 'Group Workspaces'.

Here you can browse the list of available GWSs. In this example, a search for the word 'climate' returned one GWS with the search term in the name or description:

**Step 2:** Select the GWS you are interested in and click the green 'Apply' button next to the 'USER' role.
Here you will be asked to provide supporting information for your application, such as your role in the project or the names of your collaborators, so the manager of the GWS can assess your eligibility.

**Step 3:** Your request to join a GWS is now pending.

**Step 4:** You will receive a notification of the outcome of your
application by email and in the Accounts Portal notifications. 

In this example, the request to join the GWS was
granted, and the status and expiry date of the grant are
displayed on the right hand side:

**Finally,** you can view all the services that you have requested or been granted access to under ['My Services'](https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/services/my_services/).
