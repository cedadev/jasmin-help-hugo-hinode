This article highlights the essential principles of working with group
workspaces.

##  Keeping informed

Please maintain contact throughout the life of the GWS via the following
channels:

  * Using the [JASMIN dashboard](https://mon.jasmin.ac.uk) to check on the status of your GWS (used versus available space).
  * Email alerts from the system when the GWS reaches >83% full
  * Email from the CEDA/JASMIN team
  * News articles on the CEDA or JASMIN websites and by monitoring CEDA social media feeds which may be used to post messages regarding system status or security. 
    * [CEDA Website](https://www.ceda.ac.uk/)
    * [CEDA News RSS feed](https://www.ceda.ac.uk//blog/feeds/rss/)
    * [CEDA on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cedanews)

If you are aware that a user who has access to your GWS leaves your project,
or, for whatever reason, no longer needs to be a member of the GWS, please let
the CEDA helpdesk know, as arrangements may need to be made to transfer the
ownership of files and/or directories to another member of the GWS (e.g. the
manager) to ensure continued access to the data.
